                    <h2>With Gratitude to FNB App Academy</h2>
                    <p>MoneySave Jr is an comes from a simple idea that
                        even the smallest savings can lead to big changes,
                        especially when you start young. This vision wouldn’t
                        have come to life without the support, training, and 
                        inspiration I received from the FNB App Academy.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for believing in the potential of young developers.
                        Through your mentorship and the full stack development programme, you've 
                        empowered the youth to turn code into creativity and creativity into purpose.</p>

                    <p>This project is not just a portfolio piece. It’s a love letter to learning, 
                        to financial literacy, and to the idea that technology can empower kids to 
                        make smarter choices.</p>

                    <p>To the mentors, coordinators, and every peer who walked this journey: Thank you. 
                        This is just the beginning.</p>
